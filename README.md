# GriefPrevention - The self-service anti-griefing Bukkit plugin for Minecraft servers since 2011.

Stop responding to grief and prevent it instead. GriefPrevention stops grief 
before it starts automatically without any effort from administrators, 
and with very little (self service) effort from players.
Because GriefPrevention teaches players for you, you won't have to publish a
training manual or tutorial for players, or add explanatory signs to your world.
